HOW TO INSTALL SERVITOR BOT (FREE METHOD)
=========================================

Since this extension is not on the Chrome Web Store, you can install it manually for free using "Developer Mode".

INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Unzip this "ServitorBot_Package" folder to a safe place on your computer (don't delete it later!).
2.  Open Google Chrome.
3.  In the address bar, type: chrome://extensions  and hit Enter.
4.  In the top-right corner, turn ON the switch for "Developer mode".
5.  Click the "Load unpacked" button that appears in the top-left.
6.  Select the folder where you unzipped these files.

That's it! The "Servitor Bot" icon should appear in your toolbar.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If Chrome asks to "Disable developer mode extensions" on restart, just click "Keep changes" or "Cancel". This is normal for manual installations.
- Make sure your microphone permission is allowed when you first use it.
